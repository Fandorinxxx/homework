/**
 You are asked to help with Java programming in a Pie company. At the moment they bake and sell pies,
 cakes and tarts packed in a nice boxes. Unfortunately, approach to boxes programming is quite outdated
 â€“ each pie type requires its own box class. This approach is poorly scalable and will turn the situation into
 a nightmare with product range growth (imagine all these ApplePieBox, StrawberryPieBox, etc.).

 To avoid this implement universal Box class that will accomodate anything with put and give it back with get methods.

 Sample Input:
 Magical Box class

 Sample Output:
 Well done!
