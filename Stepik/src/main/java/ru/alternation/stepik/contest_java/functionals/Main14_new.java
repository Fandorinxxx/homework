/**
 2.14 The chain of responsibility pattern in the functional style

 There is a class Request(data: String) for representing some XML requests in a payment system.
 The class has a getter method getData() and a constructor with one argument (data). See below.

 Typically, the value of data looks like shown below (in a human-readable format, in processing it's a single line string).

 <request>
    <transaction>
        <type>payment</type>
        <sum>100000</sum>
        <order_id>e94dc619-6172-4ffe-aae8-63112c551570</order>
        <desc>We'd like to buy an elephant</desc>
    </transaction>
    <digest>CZVMYTgc3iiOdJjFP+6dhQ==</digest>
 </request>

 You should to write the chain of responsibility pattern in functional style for stage-by-stage request creating.
 For this:
 1) write a functional interface RequestHandler with a single abstract method handle and a default method; the first
    is needed for using lambda expressions and should accept a Request and returns new Request with changed data,
    the second is for combining several handlers into the one.
 2) create a commonRequestHandler combined from three existing handlers: wrapInTransactionTag,
    createDigest and wrapInRequestTag.

 Important. Use the provided template for your solution. Do not change it and read comments in the code.
 The template is long enough, scroll it to the bottom. All comments where your code is expected start with !!!

 In the next step, you can read how the requests should be created. Keep in mind, all handlers with logic are already
 implemented and available for you. You need to write only a suitable functional interface and compose all existing
 handlers as functions into one commonRequestHandler to follow the described algorithm.
