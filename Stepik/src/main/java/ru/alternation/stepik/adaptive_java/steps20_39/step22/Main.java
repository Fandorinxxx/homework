/**
 # 1.22 Shape

 Write a program, which reads the number of the shape (1 â€“ square, 2 â€“ circle, 3 â€“ triangle, 4 â€“ rhombus) and prints
 the text "You have chosen a square" (or circle, or triangle, or rhombus, depending on the number). If it is a number,
 which doesn't correspond to any of the listed shapes, the program should output: "There is no such shape!".

 Note: output text should exactly match the sample! Including letters case and location of spaces.


 Sample Input:
 1

 Sample Output:
 You have chosen a square
