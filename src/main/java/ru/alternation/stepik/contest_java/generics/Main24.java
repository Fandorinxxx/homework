 Pie company is looking for talanted baker and you are invited to implement one. The baker's duty is to get orders
 for bakery and it's varieties and produce it. Class definition and method's backbone follows:

 ...

 The task is to redesign method signature types if needed and to add implementation. The bake method should conform to the following:
 - Create objects of class Bakery or any subclass of it according to class argument
 - Flag compile-time error if order argument is not Bakery or any subclass of it (e.g. if it is Paper or Object)

 ï»¿It's guaranteed that all subclasses of Bakery will have public parameterless constructor.
